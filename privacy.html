            <p>
              Wherever we transfer personal data to other countries, we will

              We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to

              use encryption and other technologies that can assist in securing
              the information you provide. We also require our service providers
              to comply with equivalent data privacy and security requirements.
            </p>

            <p><strong>How long will information about you be kept?</strong></p>
            <p>
              We will retain information about you for the period necessary to
              fulfil the purposes for which the information was collected in
              accordance with our internal data retention standards. After that,
              we will delete it. The period will vary depending on the purposes
              for which the information was collected. Note that in some
              circumstances, you have the right to request us to delete the
              information. Also, we are sometimes legally obliged to retain the
              information, for example, for tax and accounting purposes.

              request us to restrict our using it, in certain circumstances;
            </p>
