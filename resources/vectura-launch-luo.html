            <h2>Edmonton, AB, and Stamford, CT – September 9, 2024</h2>
            <p>
              Aurora Cannabis Inc. (“Aurora”) (NASDAQ | TSX: ACB), a leading
              Canadian-based global medical cannabis company, and Vectura Fertin
              Pharma, Inc., an innovator in wellness and healthcare, are pleased
              to announce the launch of the newly developed Luo CBD lozenge. The
              high-quality CBD lozenge was developed by Vectura Fertin Pharma
              and adheres to stringent safety, quality and regulatory standards
              to address unmet medical and health needs. It is the first of
              Vectura Fertin Pharma’s medical cannabis products to launch in
              Canada. The CBD lozenge is being manufactured, packaged and
              labelled by Cogent, a Vectura Fertin Pharma subsidiary, for sale
              and will be distributed by Aurora through its leading
              direct-to-patient e-commerce platform. The CBD lozenge, which has
              a novel dissolvable format and is easy to dose, is now available
              for patients on Aurora’s Canadian medical cannabis patient
              platform as authorised by healthcare professionals.
            </p>
            <h2>Miguel Martin, CEO for Aurora said:</h2>
            <p>
              “As the leading provider of medical cannabis in Canada, the launch
              of the newly developed Luo CBD lozenge on our platform is a
              significant and exciting milestone at the beginning of our
              strategic collaboration with Vectura Fertin Pharma. We are
              committed to bringing innovative solutions to patients and this
              launch reinforces our position at the forefront of Canada’s
              medical cannabis industry.”
            </p>
            <h2>Michael Kunst, CEO for Vectura Fertin Pharma, said:</h2>
            <p>
              “The launch of our newly developed Luo CBD lozenge on Aurora’s
              medical cannabis patient platform closely follows the announcement
              of our joint commercial collaboration in August this year, and is
              testament to our pioneering approach to science-backed innovation
              to address unmet medical and health needs. Aurora has the largest
              patient platform in Canada and the launch will enable us to make a
              meaningful impact to patients and to validate our product’s
              proposition through real-world patient data.” Through Aurora’s
              leading patient platform, Cogent will gain access to patient
              feedback on the CBD lozenge, which will be used to validate the
              product proposition and to build real-world patient data to inform
              future products. The two companies will explore opportunities
              regarding the potential commercialisation of other Vectura Fertin
              Pharma medical cannabis products in Canada.
