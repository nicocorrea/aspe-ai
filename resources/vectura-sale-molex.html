              STAMFORD, CT–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Sep. 17, 2024– Vectura Fertin Pharma,
              Inc., an affiliate of Philip Morris International Inc. (PMI)
              (NYSE: PM), today announces the sale of its subsidiary Vectura
              Group Ltd. (Vectura) to Molex Asia Holdings Ltd., and the
              establishment of master service agreements to develop Vectura
              Fertin Pharma’s inhaled therapeutics proprietary pipeline. Vectura
              will be operated by Phillips Medisize, a Molex company. The sale
              includes upfront cash consideration of GBP 150 million, subject to
              customary purchase price adjustments, and potential deferred
              payments of up to GBP 148 million. The transaction is subject to
              customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval.
            </p>
            <p>
              <i
                >“In line with our ambitions, Vectura has enabled us to develop
                a proprietary pipeline of inhaled therapeutics, and we remain
                committed to driving innovation in this space over the
                long-term,”</i
              >said Jacek Olczak, PMI Chief Executive Officer.
            </p>
            <p>
              PMI’s 2021 acquisition of Vectura has been instrumental in
              kick-starting Vectura Fertin Pharma’s development of inhaled
              therapeutics, bringing to the company specialist knowledge,
              technologies, and formulation science. However, despite the
              investment and commitment to developing products and therapies
              vital to patients, unwarranted opposition to PMI’s transformation
              has impacted Vectura’s scientific engagement and commercial CDMO
              relationships.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mr. Olczak added:
              <i
                >“With its experience in pharmaceutical drug delivery devices
                and its global manufacturing footprint, Phillips Medisize is
                best placed to lead Vectura into the future—while releasing it
                from the unreasonable burden of external constraints and
                criticism related to our ownership.”</i
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              The remaining units of Vectura Fertin Pharma will continue to
              operate as a separate company under PMI’s ownership and will be
              given a new corporate identity. This business will focus on
              developing and commercializing oral consumer health and wellness
              offerings and inhaled prescription products for therapy areas that
              include pain management and cardiovascular emergencies.

            </p>
            <p>
              Philip Morris International (PMI) is a leading international
              tobacco company, actively delivering a smoke-free future and
              evolving its portfolio for the long term to include products
              outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. The company’s current
              product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free
              products. Since 2008, PMI has invested over $12.5 billion to
              develop, scientifically substantiate, and commercialize innovative
              smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to
              smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes.
              This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment
              capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems
              toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as
              post-market studies. In 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match—a leader
              in oral nicotine delivery—creating a global smoke-free champion
              led by the companies’ IQOS and ZYN brands. The U.S. Food and Drug
              Administration has authorized versions of PMI’s IQOS devices and
              consumables and Swedish Match’s General snus as Modified Risk
              Tobacco Products, and renewal applications for these products are
              presently pending before the FDA. As of June 30, 2024, PMI’s
              smoke-free products were available for sale in 90 markets, and PMI
              estimates that 36.5 million adults around the world use PMI’s
              smoke-free products. Smoke-free business accounted for
              approximately 38% of PMI’s total first-half 2024 net revenues.
              With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life
              sciences, PMI announced in February 2021 its ambition to expand
              into wellness and healthcare areas and, through its Vectura Fertin
              Pharma business, aims to enhance life through the delivery of
              seamless health experiences. “PMI” refers to Philip Morris
              International Inc. and its subsidiaries. For more information,

            <p><strong>Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements</strong></p>
            <p>
              This press release contains projections of future results and
              goals and other forward-looking statements, including statements
              regarding the timing of and ability to complete the Vectura sale
              transaction; expected benefits of the transaction and of the
              continuing commercial relationship; the receipt of deferred
              payments; expected operational performance; and business plans and
              strategies. Achievement of future results is subject to risks,
              uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. In the event that risks
              or uncertainties materialize, or underlying assumptions prove
              inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those
              contained in such forward-looking statements. Pursuant to the
              “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation
              Reform Act of 1995, PMI is identifying important factors that,
              individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and
              outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any
              forward-looking statements made by PMI. The factors that may
              adversely impact the anticipated outcomes include, among others:
              the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that
              could give rise to the termination of the transaction agreement;
              the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted
              against the parties or others related to the transaction
              agreement; conditions to the completion of the transaction may not
              be satisfied, or the regulatory approvals required for the
              transaction may not be obtained on the terms expected or on the
              anticipated schedule; the parties’ ability to meet expectations
              regarding the timing, completion and other elements of the
              transaction may be different than currently planned; and the
              possibility that the expected benefits of the transaction, of the
              continuing commercial relationship between the parties, or of
              PMI’s business plans and strategies may not materialize in the
              expected manner or timeframe, if at all. PMI is further subject to
              other risks detailed from time to time in its publicly filed
              documents, including PMI’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
              fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, and the Quarterly
              Report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.
              PMI cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not a
              complete discussion of all potential risks and uncertainties. PMI
              does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that it
              may make from time to time, except in the normal course of its
              public disclosure obligations.
